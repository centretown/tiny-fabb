Say you start machining something or are about to start the next step in a job and the power goes out, you re-start Grbl and Grbl has no idea where it is due to steppers being open-loop control.

Second, ensure your limit switch pins are not showing as 'triggered' in Grbl's status reports. If are, check your wiring and settings.

Basic usage: Use M486 T to tell the firmware how many objects there are, so it can provide an LCD interface. (Otherwise the firmware counts them up in the first layer.) In every layer of your G-code, you must preface each object's layer slice with M486 S[index] to indicate which object is being printed. The index should be zero-based. To cancel the first object, use M486 P0; to cancel the 5th object use M486 P4; and so on. The \"current\" object is canceled with M486 C.",
      "G-codes associated with the canceled objects are no longer printed. Firmware supports this feature by ignoring G0-G3/G5 moves in XYZ while updating F and keeping the E coordinate up-to-date without extruding.",
      "Slicers should number purge towers and other global features with a negative index (or other flag) to distinguish them from regular print objects, since it is important to preserve color changes, purge towers, and brims.",
      "Host software (such as OctoPrint) may be able to cancel individual objects through a plugin, and in this case they should not use M486 P to cancel objects (although doing so should cause no harm)."

      "Polynomial compensation is an experimental method to compensate for geometric distortion of a delta machine Z-plane. After the bed is compensated with the set of G30 points, there remains error. This method fits a 6th degree polynomial with independent origins for each order to the residual error data (using a simulated annealing technique on the host). The polynomial is communicated and controlled through M668. Because the polynomial takes many floating point operations to compute each point, the firmware builds a grid of values, and used bi-linear interpolation to adjust the actual Z-axis offset error estimate.",

The other is composed of a special set of characters that will immediately command Grbl to do a task in real-time. It's not part of the g-code stream. Grbl's system commands do things like control machine state, report saved parameters or what Grbl is doing, save or print machine settings, run a homing cycle, or make the machine move faster or slower than programmed. This document describes these \"internal\" system Grbl commands, what they do, how they work, and how to use them.",
